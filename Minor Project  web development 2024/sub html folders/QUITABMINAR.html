            <h2>REFERENCE</h2>

            <p>
                In India, the second-tallest historical monument is the Qutub Minar, located in Delhi at Aurobindo Marg, Mehrauli. The monument is a 73-metre tall tower with a base diameter of 14.3 metres, a top diameter of 2.7 metres, 379 staircases, and a five-storey building. It was built to celebrate the victory of the Mughals over the Rajputs and is called the victory tower. Qutub Minar is made in a unique architectural style using red sandstones and marble. It is considered a very famous building worldwide and is also included in the list of world heritage sites.
                Who Built the Qutub Minar?
                Qutab-ud-Din Aibak started the construction of Qutub Minar, but his son-in-law Iltutmish completed it in 1200. A.D., the entire structure of the Minar was completed. It is considered an excellent masterpiece of the Mughals, carved beautifully with several storeys. Qutub Minar attracts lakhs of visitors every year, and people come from various places. The historical monument has faced natural disasters like earthquakes, but fortunately, it was restored and renovated by multiple rulers of that time. Firoz Shah renovated its top two floors that were damaged in the earthquake. Sikander Lodi, in 1505, carried out another restoration, and in 1794 Major Smith repaired the damaged part of the Minar. The visiting hours start at 6 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. every day of the week.

                Many years ago, the Minar was built using sandstones, red stones and marble. The Minar consists of several flanged and cylindrical shafts and balconies on separate storeys. Qutub Minar’s first three levels were built using red stones, and the fourth and fifth storeys used sandstone and marble. At this Minar, the first mosque in India was built, Quwwat-ul-Islam. The Minar walls are inscribed with different verses of the Quran. The wall also speaks about history written in Devanagari and Arabic characters. An iron pillar of 7 metres inside the Qutub complex is inscribed with Brahmic inscriptions.
