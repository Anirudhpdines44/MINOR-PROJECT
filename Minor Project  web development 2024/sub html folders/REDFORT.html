                From Akbar to Jahangir, India was under the Mughal dynasty for many years and witnessed various changes in the country. Various invaders ruled India, but the Mughals ruled over India for about four hundred years. During these periods, the Mughals advanced their artistic abilities and constructed many historical monuments in Delhi and Agra. One of the most prominent monuments is the Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, which signifies the Mughal powers. It is well known for its architecture and other unique features. The Red Fort was built by the famous Mughal ruler Shah Jahan in the year 1648. The foundation stone was laid in 1639, and it took almost nine years to be fully constructed. The fort is made up of red sandstone and marble, which makes it unique among other historical monuments. The Red Fort is located on the banks of the Yamuna river and opposite to the Chandni Chowk market. The Red Fort is one of the oldest historical structures India can ever have. Even though it has witnessed several years, it still stands young. It is known to be one of the wonders of the world. The Red Fort is famous for its massive walls enclosing it for safety. Every year, on the 15th of August, the Prime Minister of India addresses the country from the Red Fort. It is one of Indiaâ€™s most impressive and historically significant structures
