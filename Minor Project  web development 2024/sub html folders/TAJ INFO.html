                Taj Mahal: The Symbol of Love
                The Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world. It is recognized as one of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world and was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in memory of his honourable and beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after she passed away. It is said that Shah Jahan gifted the Taj Mahal to his wife. It represents the love and bond of husband and wife and is recognized as the symbol of love. Interestingly, the Taj Mahal is believed to reflect the different moods of Mumtaz because it is pinkish in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines.
                
                Shah Jahan made four promises to his wife when she was alive. These promises include building the Taj, marrying again, visiting the tomb on every death anniversary, and being gentle with his children. After two years, he decided to make a monument to honour the memory of his wife. So, he decided to build an exceptional monument that had never been constructed before. He turned it into a reality by making the Taj Mahal with the effort of 20,000 workers. It took 22 years to complete the construction of the Taj Mahal. It was also suspected that Shah Jahan cut the hands of all the 20,000 workers so that they would never build this type of monument again.
