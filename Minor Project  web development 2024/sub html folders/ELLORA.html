            <p> Ellora Caves
It is located nearly 100 Kms away from Ajanta caves in the Sahyadri range of Maharashtra.
The temples and monasteries extending over more than 2 km, were dug side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff.  The structures were excavated out of the vertical face of the Charanandri hills.
Ellora Caves are one of the largest rock-cut Hindu temple cave complexes in the world.
Ellora caves are a group of 100 caves at the site of which 34 caves are open to the public. 17 caves out of these 34 are themed around Hinduism, 12 caves depict the themes of Buddhist and 5 caves are of Jain faith.
The set of caves in Ellora were developed during the period between the 5th century and 11th century A.D. by various guilds from Vidarbha, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 
Ellora caves are newer as compared to Ajanta caves. The chronology of constructions is as follows – 550 AD to 600 AD – Hindu Phase, 600 AD to 730 AD – Buddhist Phase, and 730 AD to 950 AD – Hindu and Jain Phase.
The most remarkable of the Ellora cave temples is Kailasa Temple (Kailasanatha; cave 16),  It features the largest single monolithic rock excavation in the world. It is named for the mountain in the Kailasa Range of the Himalayas where the Hindu god Shiva resides.
The patronage of Ellora monuments includes Rashtrakutas, Kalachuris, Chalukyas and the Yadavas. The Rashtrakuta dynasty and Kalachuris constructed part of the Hindu and Buddhist caves of Ellora and the Yadava dynasty constructed a number of the Jain caves. They were built close to one another and illustrated the religious harmony that existed in ancient India.
